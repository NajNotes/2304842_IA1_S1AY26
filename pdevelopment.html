                                <p>
                                    Michael seeks out an old friend of his, Charlie, for some advice. He seems to be fond of him and has received good advice from him before. Recently, however, he's found himself feeling stuck, like he isn't ‘living up to his potential'. Hearing this, Charlie, being as wise as he is, offers him a clear path to remedying his problem. He explains the importance of writing his goals
                                     down and the powerful effect the process would have on Michael as a person. 
                                     They talk about how putting the goals on paper sets a clear path, allowing the brain to begin actualizing and working towards their goals now that they are in their mind. I believe this chapter offers a lot of insight into achieving the goals you set for yourself. 
                                     While I have some idea of what my goals are, ever so often, I find myself unsure of what my next step should be. 
                                     If I began writing them down, maybe I'd find myself gaining the same amount of clarity as Michael.

                                <p>
                                    Chapter 5 speaks more about time management. 
                                    Charlie explains to Michael the importance of prioritizing your goals, allowing himself to fall into the same mindless trap of always looking at the ‘urgent', 
                                    makes it impossible for him to even perceive what's important. He gives some perspective on the challenges most people face, 
                                    explaining how time is like a currency and how crucial it is to be a master of your own time, rather than a slave to it. He urges Michael to spend his time wisely, 
                                    in a way that is meaningful to him; in a way that helps him to achieve his goals. He even goes as far as to warn him of what may await him down the line, speaking of his ‘deathbed' and how the realization that he wasted his life would crush him in the end. 
                                    This has a profound effect on me; life is never as simple as I would want it. And there are always things that seem more important than the tasks that would bring me to my goals. However, I must assess myself daily and reflect on how I spend each day doing what is truly important, 
                                    rather than what's always urgent.

                                <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
                                <p>
                                    This chapter speaks about the people that we surround ourselves with. Everyone we meet is an association, and depending on that person's attitude, goals, and aspirations, 
                                    we'd need to decide if they are worth keeping around or not. 
                                    While thinking of relationships that way seems rude or sardonic, 
                                    even, it's important to keep in mind the type of effect your relationships will have on you as a person. 
                                    Charlie gives a good example of this: “Successful people will only want to surround themselves with people who are successful themselves, 
                                    or those who push them to improve and to continue achieving.” This forces Michael to take a hard look at his own situation, and he recognizes that his closest friends, while he loves them, 
                                    might not be the best influence on his life. The lesson I've taken from this chapter is a rather hard one. Sometimes, we get comfortable with the people around us, 
                                    and we may feel that leaving them or restricting their access to us will cause them harm. What's important is to think about where you want to be and if they are helping you get there. Personally, 
                                    I'd have tried to influence them on the right path rather than abandoning them outright, but not everyone can be convinced, and that's ok.
